# [QuEST](https://quest.qtechtheory.org)

## Introduction

The **Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit** is a high performance simulator of universal quantum circuits, state-vectors and density matrices. QuEST is written in C, hybridises OpenMP and MPI, and can run on a GPU. Needing only compilation, QuEST is easy to run both on laptops and supercomputers (in both C and C++), where it can take advantage of multicore, GPU-accelerated and networked machines to quickly simulate circuits on many qubits.

QuEST has a simple interface, independent of its run environment (on CPUs, GPUs or over networks),
```C
hadamard(qubits, 0);

controlledNot(qubits, 0, 1);

rotateY(qubits, 0, .1);
```
though is flexible
```C
Vector v;
v.x = 1; v.y = .5; v.z = 0;
rotateAroundAxis(qubits, 0, 3.14/2, v);
```
and powerful
```C
// sqrt(X) with pi/4 global phase
ComplexMatrix2 u = {
    .real = {{.5, .5}, { .5,.5}},
    .imag = {{.5,-.5}, {-.5,.5}}};
unitary(qubits, 0, u);

int controls[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
multiControlledUnitary(qureg, controls, 5, 0, u);
```

QuEST can simulate decoherence on mixed states, output [QASM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03429), perform measurements, apply gates with any number of control qubits, and provides cheap/fast access to the underlying statevector. QuEST offers precision-agnostic real and imaginary (additionally include `QuEST_complex.h`) number types, the precision of which can be modified at compile-time, as can the target hardware.

## Getting started

QuEST is contained entirely in the files in the `QuEST/` folder. To use QuEST, copy this folder to your computer and include `QuEST.h` in your `C` or `C++` code, and compile using cmake with the provided [CMakeLists.txt file](/CMakeLists.txt). See the [tutorial](/examples/README.md) for an introduction, and view the full API [here](https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/QuEST_8h.html).

We also include example [submission scripts](examples/submissionScripts/) for using QuEST with SLURM and PBS. 

### Quick Start

Copy or clone this repository to your machine. E.g. in the desired directory, enter
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quest-kit/QuEST.git
cd QuEST
```
at terminal. You can then compile the [example](examples/tutorial_example.c) using
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
then run it with
```bash
./demo
```
and afterward, clean up with
```bash
make clean
````

or, to remove the build directory entirely, from the root directory
```bash
rm -r build
```

The program will print information about your execution environment and some simple operations on a three qubit system. See the [tutorial](examples/README.md) for a better introduction. 

Additionally, you can run unit tests to see if QuEST runs correctly in your environment, using
```bash
make test
```

This requires Python 3.4+. 

## Documentation

View the API [here](https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/QuEST_8h.html), and check compatible compiler versions [here](tests/compilers/compatibility.md).

> For developers: To recreate the full documentation after making changes to the code, run doxygen doxyconf in the root directory. This will generate documentation in Doxygen_doc/html, and can be accessed through index.html in that folder.
