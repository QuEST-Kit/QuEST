These folders contain example `C` and `C++` files which use QuEST's [API](https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/group__api.html), helping illustrate how to use specific functions. Instructions for compiling and running them are given in [`compile.md`](/docs/compile.md#tests) and [`launch.md`](/docs/launch.md#tests) respectively, though some are automatically run by Github Actions.
<!-- @todo the above links would fail Doxygen, which does not recognise the #section syntax.
     no problem here however because doxygen fails to render this page all together -->

A description of each folder is given within.
