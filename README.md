## Introduction

The **Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit** is a high performance simulator of universal quantum circuits, state-vectors and density matrices. QuEST is written in C, hybridises OpenMP and MPI, and can run on a GPU. Needing only compilation, QuEST is easy to run both on laptops and supercomputers (in both C and C++), where it can take advantage of multicore, GPU-accelerated and networked machines to quickly simulate circuits on many qubits.

QuEST has a simple interface, independent of its run environment (on CPUs, GPUs or over networks),
```C
hadamard(qubits, 0);

controlledNot(qubits, 0, 1);

rotateY(qubits, 0, .1);
```
though is flexible
```C
Vector v;
v.x = 1; v.y = .5; v.z = 0;
rotateAroundAxis(qubits, 0, 3.14/2, v);
```
and powerful
```C
// sqrt(X) with pi/4 global phase
ComplexMatrix2 u = {
    .real = {{.5, .5}, { .5,.5}},
    .imag = {{.5,-.5}, {-.5,.5}}};
unitary(qubits, 0, u);

int controls[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
multiControlledUnitary(qureg, controls, 5, 0, u);
```

QuEST can simulate decoherence on mixed states, output [QASM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03429), perform measurements, apply general unitaries with any number of control and target qubits, and boasts cheap/fast access to the underlying numerical representation of the state. QuEST offers precision-agnostic real and imaginary (additionally include `QuEST_complex.h`) number types, the precision of which can be modified at compile-time, as can the target hardware.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [quest.qtechtheory.org/docs](https://quest.qtechtheory.org/docs/), and the API is available [here](https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/modules.html) (all functions listed [here](https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/QuEST_8h.html)). See also the [tutorial](/examples/README.md).

> **For developers**: To regenerate the API doc after making changes to the code, run `doxygen doxyconfig/config` in the root directory. This will generate documentation in `Doxygen_doc/html`, the contents of which should be copied into [`docs/`](/docs/)). Make sure that `PROJECT_NUMBER` in `doxyconfig/config` is up to date!

---------------------------------

## Getting started

QuEST is contained entirely in the files in the `QuEST/` folder. To use QuEST, copy this folder to your computer and include `QuEST.h` in your `C` or `C++` code, and compile using cmake with the provided [CMakeLists.txt file](/CMakeLists.txt). See the [tutorial](/examples/README.md) for an introduction. We also include example [submission scripts](examples/submissionScripts/) for using QuEST with SLURM and PBS.

### Quick Start

#### MacOS & Linux

MacOS and Linux users can clone this repository to your machine through the terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quest-kit/QuEST.git
cd QuEST
```
Compile the [example](examples/tutorial_example.c) using
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
then run it with
```bash
./demo
```

#### Windows

Windows users should install [Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) for Visual Studio, [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/).
Then, in a *Developer Command Prompt for VS*, run
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/quest-kit/QuEST.git"
cd QuEST
```
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
make
```
```bash
demo.exe
```


#### Tests
Additionally, you can run QuEST's rigorous unit tests in your own environment,
which should take no longer than ten minutes.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DTESTING=ON
make
make test
```
