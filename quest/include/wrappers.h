/** @file
 * C-compatible functions which are alternatives to C++-only API
 * functions, ultimately providing an identical interface. This is 
 * necessary because these functions otherwise pass qcomps by-value
 * which is prohibited between C and C++ compiled binaries (because
 * complex numbers are not agreed upon in their ABI, despite having 
 * identical memory layouts in the C and C++ standard libraries).
 * Ergo this file defines no new API functions as far as the user/
 * documentation is aware, but secretly ensures the backend C++ 
 * binaries are send qcomps from the user's C code only by pointer.
 * 
 * Note that matrix getters and setters (like getCompMatr1()) are
 * missing from this file, even though they contain qcomp[2][2] (which
 * are NOT pointers) and cannot be directly passed between binaries.
 * Those functions are instead defined in matrices.h/.cpp because
 * those structs are declared 'const'; they must be intiailised inline, 
 * and can never be modified by pointer. We shouldn't even address them!
