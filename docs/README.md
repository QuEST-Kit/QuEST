QuEST has been overhauled! See

- 🎉  [`v4.md`](v4.md) for the exciting new features.

To get started with QuEST, check out

- 🔧  [`compilers.md`](compilers.md) for a list of compatible compilers.
- 🔗  [`qtechtheory.org`](https://quest.qtechtheory.org/download/) for some help downloading compilers.
- 🛠️  [`compile.md`](compile.md) for instructions on compiling.
- ⚙️  [`cmake.md`](cmake.md) for a list of compiler variables.
- 🚀  [`launch.md`](launch.md) to learn how to run QuEST on laptops to supercomputers.
- 🎓  [`tutorial.md`](tutorial.md) for an introductory tutorial.
- 📋  [API](https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/group__api.html) for the documentation of each function.

Interested in contributing? Then check out:

- ❤️  [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) to learn how to make a pull request.
- 🏗️  [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) to understand the code structure.
- 🎨  [`styleguide.md`](styleguide.md) for some tips on writing neat code.

Want to learn how what's under the hood? Read the
- 🏆  [whitepaper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47174-9) which featured in Scientific Report's [Top 100 in Physics](https://www.nature.com/collections/ecehgdfcba/)
- 📝  [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01512) which derives `v4`'s optimised algorithms.
- 🧪  [tests](/tests) which compare QuEST's outputs to non-optimised calculations.
- 📈  [benchmarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) which are coming soon!
