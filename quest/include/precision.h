// can be (for example) int, long, long long, unsigned, long unsigned, long long unsigned.
// We make sure that the backend never relies upon being able to represent negative 
// indices (e.g. as flags) since that would require a strictly signed type. Note this precision
// determines qindex which is user-facing so using unsigned types opens the users to the
// risks of underflowing. Since we never store large collections of this type, there is little 
// benefit in shrinking the type size and facing the associated precision risks. Similarly,
// there is little benefit in making it larger since a 'long long int' can represent 62 qubits,
// which is already well beyond simulability, requiring 64 EiB total at double precision.

/*
 * PAULI STRING INDEXING TYPE
 */

// should never be changed; it is unsigned due to its use in extensive bitwise processing
// (no overflow risks since the API does not use this type), and its precision constrains
// the number of Paulis which can be specified in a PauliStr. Specifically, PauliStr stores
// two PAULI_MASK_TYPE instances, each of which are interpreted as half the digits of a 
// base-4 numeral encoding the Pauli string. A single 64-bit 'long long unsigned' can ergo
// specify only 32 qubits, whereas two can specify more qubits (64) than we can simulate.
// This type is defined purely to avoid littering the source with explicit typing.
