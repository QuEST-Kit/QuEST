This folder contains _extended_ examples which demonstrate the use of QuEST in standalone applications, such as the emulation of canonical quantum algorithms. We provide both `C` and `C++` versions (compiled against standards `C11` and `C++17`) of each example. All fines herein are _compiled_ (but not executed) by the [compile](https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST/actions/workflows/compile.yml) Github Action.
