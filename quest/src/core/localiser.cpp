 * Internal functions which localize the data needed for simulation.
 * That is, they determine whether performing a simulation requires
 * Querg amplitudes from other distributed nodes and if so, invoke
 * the necessary communication, before finally calling the 
 * embarrassingly parallel subroutines in accelerator.cpp. This is
 * done agnostically of whether amplitudes of the Qureg are being
 * stored in RAM (CPU) or VRAM (GPU).
